# React + Vite

The directory structure uses atomic design by using different names for the directories :

-  component
   -  elements => as atoms
   -  fragments => as molecules
   -  modules => as organisms
   -  templates => as templates
-  pages

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

-  [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-  [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
